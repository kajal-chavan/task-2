Automated Data Report Generator

Company: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS
Domain: Python Programming
Duration: 4 Weeks
Mentor: Neela Santosh


>> Project Overview

This project demonstrates automated report generation using Python. It reads data from a CSV file, analyzes the dataset, and generates a well-formatted PDF report using the FPDF library. The goal is to automate the process of summarizing datasets, providing both an overview and a sample of the data in an easy-to-read PDF format.


>> Objectives

Read and process data from CSV files using Pandas

Analyze datasets to extract key insights such as total rows, total columns, column names, and missing values

Generate automated PDF reports with summaries and a preview of the first 10 rows

Demonstrate practical usage of Python libraries for automation, reporting, and visualization



>> Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: pandas → data manipulation, fpdf → PDF generation

IDE Used: IDLE



>> Process

1. Data Preparation – Sample data is created and stored in a CSV file. This includes basic information like Name, Age, Department, and Salary.

2. Data Analysis – Using Pandas, the project calculates:

Total rows and columns

Column names

Number of missing values per column


3. PDF Report Generation – The FPDF library is used to create a structured PDF:

Custom header and footer

Summary section with dataset insights

Table preview of the first 10 rows for reference


4. Automation – Once the CSV is ready, running the script automatically generates a polished PDF report.




-> Output
✅ data.csv file created successfully!
✅ Report generated: Report_FPDF.pdf
